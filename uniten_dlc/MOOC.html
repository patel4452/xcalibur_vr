        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are online courses available for anyone with a computer and access to the internet. MOOCs provide an affordable and flexible way to learn new skills for career advancement and deliver quality educational experiences at scale. MOOCs offer students a way to learn in a setting like an online class but are usually loosely structured and can be accessed without committing to an academic programme (MQA,2019) <br>
          <br>• The keyword “massive” is associated with the capacity of the course offered to serve large numbers of learners <br>• “Open Online” refers to MOOCs that can be accessed anywhere by connecting to the  Internet to provide synchronous and/or asynchronous interactions between the participants (instructors and learners) and the content of the course. <br>• A MOOC is facilitated by at least an instructor whether it is offered as an in-session or a self-paced mode. <br>
          <br>UNITEN MOOCs include fundamental topics, special interest, and niche courses in energy and technology as well as generic MPU courses that can be credit-transferred to any Malaysian university.
