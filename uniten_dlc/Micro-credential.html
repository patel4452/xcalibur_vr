        <h2 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1">What is Micro-Credentials</h2>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> Micro-credential (MC) offers a more dynamic, competitive, demand-driven, shorter and less expensive alternative to the traditional degree. As their name implies, MCs focus on much smaller modules of learning than those covered in conventional academic awards, which often allow learners to complete the required work over a shorter period (MQA, 2019). <br>
          <br>In their most developed form, MCs represent more than mere recognition of smaller modules of learning. They form part of a digital credentialing ecosystem, made possible by digital communications technologies, establishing networks of interest through which people can share information about what a learner knows and can do (Milligan and Kennedy, in James et al., 2017). <br>
          <br>Interested learners may take UNITEN micro-credential modules to upgrade their knowledge and skill set, with minimal investment in time and cost. Completion of a series of micro-credential modules will be rewarded with a digital badge that is recognised by accreditation bodies and the industry.
