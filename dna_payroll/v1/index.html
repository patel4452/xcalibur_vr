					<p class="copy-text">The core idea behind human resource management is rather intuitive: to manage employees in a way that is most effective in bringing out the company’s fullest potential. This can come in the form of building up your workers’ skills and motivation, setting an appropriate level of employee benefits, and more.</p>
					<p class="copy-text">A representative from The Access Group, a leading providers of business management software to UK, Ireland, and Asia Pacific mid-market organisations, highlights how features such as payroll software which automate processes efficiently and accurately can enable company efficiency and productivity.</p>
					<p class="copy-text">“Minimising the manual drudgery of HR work through automated processes helps with fostering positive employee experiences and create digitally driven environments, as well as also empower business owners to focus on other important aspects of their business, and push for more initiatives on its digital transformation journey."</p>
					<h3 class="pt-5">The future of HR is already here: <br class="hidden-xs">More than just management</h3>
					<p class="copy-text">A study published in the International Journal of Business and Management found that employee engagement is closely linked with organisational performance. </p>
					<p class="copy-text">That is why digital HR tools of today aim to bring more than production efficiency. Great HR software focuses on integrating employees as a part of the company’s DNA – fostering a culture that inspires talented workers to stay connected, motivated and loyal throughout their tenure at the company.</p>

					<p class="banner-caption">Participating in a vibrant work culture helps keep staff invigorated to do their best work.</p>
					<p class="copy-text">A spokesperson for JustLogin, a Singapore-based HR software company that emphasises an employee-first approach on its platform, says, “With the ever-growing demand for a limited supply of top talent, employees can now have their pick from more job opportunities than before. </p>
					<p class="copy-text">“Businesses will need to address the needs and wants of their potential employees, from remuneration and benefits down to a seamless and user-friendly HR experience, in order to attract the best. By taking an employee-first approach, companies are well-placed to not only acquire, but retain their talents over time.”</p>
					<h3 class="pt-5"> Keep your employees engaged and connected</h3>
					<p class="copy-text">Workers need to feel connected to their company and job scope and find their day-to-day work both meaningful and valuable.</p>

					<p class="banner-caption">Employees who have agency over their work environment are more likely to be invested in both their work and organisation.</p>
					<p class="copy-text">Having worked closely with Malaysian businesses over the years, head of Digi-X Lee Kathryn elaborates how its software, altHR, was designed to drive better employee empowerment and engagement by allowing them to define their work experiences and assimilate themselves into the company culture.</p>
					<p class="copy-text">"Using Check-Ins, one of altHR’s many features, employers are able to observe employee productivity, track engagement, happiness, physical health state, and even mental well-being trends through regular pulse surveys. These features can be used to help companies boost both employee engagement and satisfaction as they can keep up with the progress of their teammates easily whether they work remotely or on-site.</p>
					<p class="copy-text">If directors and management make up the brains behind a company’s operations, it is your talented and devoted employees that encompass the beating heart of your business. That’s why it is essential for any organisation looking to carve out their place in today’s economy to keep their personnel engaged, motivated, and constantly striving to do better.</p>
